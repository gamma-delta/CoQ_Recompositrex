# Recompositrex

Caves of Qud has lots of cool mechanics like encumberance, hunger and thirst, walking around, etc.
But it doesn't make you use any of them.
What if I made you use them?

The prefix for this mod is `pkrcx`; `pk` for Petra K@, `rcx` for recompositrex.
This is my brain on Minecraft namespacing.
All the `.cs` files are named without the prefix; the classes have the prefix.
I doubt you're supposed to do this but hey, it compiles.

Very not playable at the moment.
